      <h2>Treat of the month</h2> <br>
      <p> It was of course my birthday in June - now solidly in my late twenties! I had a broad range of Singaporean desserts, some I liked (mango pudding) more than others (chendol). 
        There is always the classic dish of <a href=https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1022655-kaya-toast>Kaya toast</a> which is plain white toast with a thick layer of a sweet but not cloying coconut spread.</a></p>

      <h2>Treats I'm looking forward to!</h2>
      <ul>
<li>I'm serving <a href=https://enze.com.au/collections/signature-cakes/products/hojicha-caramelised-pear-cream-cake>this cake</a> at my birthday party later in July. ENZE cakes are nice, light and fluffy and not too sweet. I like the bitter notes of hojicha, so I have high hopes for this!</li>
<li>I'm on the hunt for a crispy pain au chocolat - maybe it's time to revisit a local bakery?</li>
<li>Also I'm going to recipe develop some sort of no bake recipe - probably some sort of modified pie or cheesecake with a Kaya flavour? I've had enough tiramisu for a bit...</li>
